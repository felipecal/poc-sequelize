# poc-sequelize

This is a simple project just to validate another way of putting sequelize in a project that only uses javascript.

In this project we do not need to use index.js which is automatically generated by the yarn or npm sequelize-cli init command, which is located in ./models and also config.json which is located in ./config/config.json
