This is a simple project that validates another way of putting sequelize in a project that mainly uses javascript.ðŸ¤”

In this project, we do not need to use index.js which is automatically generated by the yarn or npm sequelize-cli init command, that is located in ./models and also config.json that is located in ./config/config.json
